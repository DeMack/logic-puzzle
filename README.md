# Logic Puzzle
The first company to respond to my resume after graduating from college gave me this logic puzzle. I recently decided
to try solve it again now that I have travelled further in my career. This repo is my solution. Feel free to try it as
well before checking out the code.

## The Puzzle
For any input `x` the application should print `x` number of alternating boxes of `1`'s and `0`'s. 

### Constraints & Allowances
* What character is in the center or outermost edge is not important
* Each "layer" of the printed output should alternate
* Must accept dynamic row number

### Examples
`x` = 0 : 
```
```

`x` = 1 :
```
1
```

`x` = 3 :
```
11111
10001
10101
10001
11111
```

`x` = 6 :
```
00000000000
01111111110
01000000010
01011111010
01010001010
01010101010
01010001010
01011111010
01000000010
01111111110
00000000000
```
